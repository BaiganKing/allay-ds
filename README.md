### Tech Stack

We use Python in Jupyter Notebooks to explore and model the data. We then save
that model and implement it within a Flask app, which is deployed to Heroku
for live deployment and prediction.

### Predictions

We use a text classifier model to categorize whether reviews posted to the
Allay Lambda School website are appropriate.

### Explanatory Variables

Ultimately, the explanatory variable is the text that is posted to the website.
This gets broken down into numerical features which are then modeled.
